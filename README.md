# hbs-code
A multiphase flow finite difference code (in development).
This is my graduation project for MSc in theoretical physics from Stockholm University.
I also did a CUDA GPU implementation of this, see (https://github.com/ljungdahl/hbs-cuda)

Currently (April 25, 2018) there is a lack of proper documentation, but I try to apply appropriate comments to the code.
