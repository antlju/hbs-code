operator overload pencil arithmetic gives
same result as += method for calc_ustar().

HYPOTHESIS:
Since I'm not creating and destroying pencils/bundles locally
I need to set them to zero before operating!
But this shouldnt be right.. differential operators should overwrite pencils.

Rather maybe rhskPncl is not implemented properly.

YEs this was the problem I think!
